👝 You will meet Larna tomorrow morning as she is an expert on the ancient Relic.
Until then you will need to prepare for your journery.
You pack the normal essentials, some dehydrated food, and a wireless comm.
You only have room for one more item.
Do you decide to take your compact yet deadly 'Flinger' or a tribal 'Token' for good luck?
