You have entered the world of Tantamount.
This world is lush and populated with all forms of life,
however only two species dominate the land.
The Indaras and the Mazeins are eternallly at odds with eachother,
yet neither is prey nor hunter to the other. One spends much of their time in bodies
of water while the other calls the treetops their home.
As both empires expand into the Age of Awareness their
ecosystems are increasingly overlapping. Leaders on both sides feel a war brewing.
